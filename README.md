[kevinstewartmercurio.com](https://www.kevinstewartmercurio.com/)Â is my personal portfolio website that I built to share a bit about myself and what I can do. This is where you'll be able to find updates on my professional life as well as projects that I'm working on. I built this site from scratch using Next.js and Tailwind and I'm hosting it with Vercel.
